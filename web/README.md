# Voice Clock

This is a silly project where you can read the current time with audio clips of your choosing, just replace (and match the name of) the ogg files in the audio folder. Additional features include a custom time override to read any desired time and a toggle to read the time on the hour. Some preloading is done so that this can work if the tab is not focused, but it does not seem to always work. This may just be a browser limitation.
